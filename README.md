# How To Make a Rhythm Game (Practice)

This repo contain notes on how to follow this unity tutorial and ALL CREDITS GOES TO THIS: https://youtu.be/cZzf1FQQFA0

The unity packages are only used if we want to go back to a certain 
feature without having additional features from the later versions of the project.
For instance, if we want to rewatch a particular video, then we can just start of with
package number corresponding to the video so that we don't have to start from the beginning.
The main project would contain all feature that would make a working game.
The purpose of this is to introduce me in how to make a rhythm game.
